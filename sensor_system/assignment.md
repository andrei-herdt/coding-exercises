# Multi-sensor system

## Description
- The scenario of this assignment is one (or several) mobile robot(s) equipped with two to three different sensors.
- The robot and the sensors are exchanging information.
- All communication happens asynchronously.
- A robot can have varying number of sensors of varying types (e.g. Lidar, Sonar, Camera, IMU, Torque).
- The robot itself can be of legged, wheeled, or flying type.
- Write a small application that shows the robot(s) communicating with their sensors.

## Remarks
- Try not to spend more than one hour on this assignment.
- Try to be as minimalistic as possible.
- The goal of this is not a practical system.
- We want you to demonstrate us your capacity to create extensible and efficient code on an example that is relevant in robotics.
- We want to see your coding style and what architectural decisions you make.
- You will be judged upon the readability of your code by programmers of different backgrounds and levels of experience.
- Your code should show how the system would be extended with additional sensors, and in what way information is being exchanged.
- Describe your design decisions in a small readme file.
- Prefer C++17 standard where you deem necessary.
